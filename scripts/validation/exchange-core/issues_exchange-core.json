(feb83a1c8f)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While CVE-2020-8908 was officially closed when we deprecated <code>Files.createTempDir</code> in <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v30.0\">Guava 30.0</a>, we've heard from users that even recent versions of Guava have been listed as vulnerable in <em>other</em> databases of security vulnerabilities. In response, we've reimplemented the method (and the very rarely used <code>FileBackedOutputStream</code> class, which had a similar issue) to eliminate the insecure behavior entirely. This change could technically affect users in a number of different ways (discussed under &quot;Incompatible changes&quot; below), but in practice, the only problem users are likely to encounter is with Windows. If you are using those APIs under Windows, you should skip 32.0.0 and go straight to <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v32.0.1\">32.0.1</a> which fixes the problem. (Unfortunately, we didn't think of the Windows problem until after the release. And while we <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava#important-warnings\">warn that <code>common.io</code> in particular may not work under Windows</a>, we didn't intend to regress support.) Sorry for the trouble.</p>\n<h4>Incompatible changes</h4>\n<p>Although this release bumps Guava's major version number, it makes <strong>no binary-incompatible changes to the <code>guava</code> artifact</strong>.</p>\n<p>One change could cause issues for Widows users, and a few other changes could cause issues for users in more usual situations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The new implementations of <code>Files.createTempDir</code> and <code>FileBackedOutputStream</code> <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/6535\">throw an exception under Windows</a>.</strong> This is fixed in <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v32.0.1\">32.0.1</a>. Sorry for the trouble.</li>\n<li>This release makes a binary-incompatible change to a <code>@Beta</code> API in the <strong>separate artifact</strong> <code>guava-testlib</code>. Specifically, we changed the return type of <code>TestingExecutors.sameThreadScheduledExecutor</code> to <code>ListeningScheduledExecutorService</code>. The old return type was a package-private class, which caused the Kotlin compiler to produce warnings. (dafaa3e435)</li>\n<li>This release <em>adds</em> two methods to the Android flavor of Guava: <code>Invokable.getAnnotatedReturnType()</code> and <code>Parameter.getAnnotatedType()</code>. Those methods do not work under an Android VM; we added them only to help our tests of the Android flavor (since we also run those tests under a JRE). Android VMs tolerate such methods as long as the app does not call them or perform reflection on them, and builds tolerate them because of our new Proguard configurations (discussed below). Thus, we expect no impact to most users. However, we could imagine build problems for users who have set up their own build system for the Android flavor of Guava. Please report any problems so that we can judge how safely we might be able to add other methods to the Android flavor in the future, such as APIs that use Java 8 classes like <code>Stream</code>.

    "body": "Hi,\r\nWhat I understand from reading project and issues, the steps of recovering the project  after a crash or deploying new version is :\r\n1. Load the last snapshot\r\n2. find the last message-id of Snapshot\r\n3. From the last message-id, replay orders from datasource\r\n\r\nSo I have some questions:\r\n1. should I make a snapshot periodically or does the project has its own process for making a snapshot?\r\n2. How do I know from what date or what id I should replay journals?\r\n\r\nThank you!",

But in OrderBookNaiveImpl class have one newOrder method which has three case i.e GTC, IOC, FOK_BUDGET. This newOrder method is responsible for trade or pending order for respective order type whatever I have understood.  OrderBookNaiveImpl class is exist under exchange.core2.core.orderbook package. Now may I use  OrderType.FOK_BUDGET option  instead of  OrderType.FOK   to get the functionality of FOK features. Because if I use OrderType.FOK then I am getting \"exchange.core2.core.orderbook.OrderBookNaiveImpl - Unsupported order type\" error.\r\n\r\nPlease help.",

This release contains no changes that break <em>binary compatibility</em> for any users.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>API documentation for Guava classes is now easier to reach. For example, for <code>ImmutableList</code>, visit <a href=\"https://guava.dev/ImmutableList\">guava.dev/ImmutableList</a>. Also, more easily access the index at <a href=\"https://guava.dev/api\">guava.dev/api</a>.</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Annotated <code>FluentIterable.from(FluentIterable)</code> with <code>@DoNotCall</code>.

(7e0fe90ca8, 5f2fbf27b2)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Made it possible to set a stable incident edge order by calling the newly added method <code>[Value]Graph.Builder.incidentEdgeOrder(ElementOrder.stable())</code>. (70164025a8)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Added <code>incidentEdgeOrder()</code> to the <code>[Value]Graph</code> interfaces.

(931e83f969)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Added <code>immediateVoidFuture</code>. (9f3bae5853)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Removed <code>@Beta</code> from <code>Service</code> and related classes. (dc46627fea)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Deprecated the 1-arg overload of <code>ServiceManager.addListener</code>. (86e3620125)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Changed the return type of <code>ServiceManager.servicesByState()</code> to <code>ImmutableSetMultimap</code> (but also retained a method with the old signature for binary compatibility).

So, I am moving forward with other tests.\r\n\r\nIm trying to implement a few user cases to start to test our user cases and learn how the engine works internally:\r\n\r\n1) Exchange configuration\r\nExchangeCore exchangeCore = ExchangeCore.builder()\r\n            .resultsConsumer(eventsProcessor)\r\n            .serializationProcessorFactory(serializationProcessorFactory)\r\n            .exchangeConfiguration(conf)\r\n            .build();\r\n\r\n2) Adding users to exchange. \r\nWe are creating users in our own backoffice.  We will push the UID required mapping it with our own ID. api.submitCommandAsync (ApiAddUser.builder ()). Is working well.\r\nWe added two users UID 301 and UID 302 following your examples.\r\n\r\n3) Balance. We are managing deposit and withdrawal into the our own backoffice. We need to maintain syncronized the balance in real-time considering trades and deposit-withdrawals. We are mapping it to the api function api.submitCommandAsync (ApiAdjustUserBalance.builder (). Is working well. \r\n\r\n4) Currency and Symbol definition: \r\nI would like to define once currency pair to start. So, we are defining BTC-USD using CoreSymbolSpecification as follow:\r\n\r\n\r\npublic static final int SYMBOL_EXCHANGE_FEE = 9340;\r\npublic static final int COIN_XBT = 3762; // satoshi, 1E-8\r\npublic static final int COIN_USD = 840;\r\n\r\npublic static final CoreSymbolSpecification SYMBOLSPECFEE_XBT_USD = CoreSymbolSpecification.builder ()\r\n        .symbolId (SYMBOL_EXCHANGE_FEE)\r\n        .type (SymbolType.CURRENCY_EXCHANGE_PAIR)\r\n        .baseCurrency (COIN_XBT) // base = satoshi\r\n        .baseScaleK (1_000_000) // 1 lot = 1M satoshi (0.01 BTC)\r\n        .quoteCurrency (COIN_USD) // quote = usd\r\n        .quoteScaleK (1) // 1 step = 1 usd\r\n        .takerFee (0) // taker fee 0 usd per 1 lot\r\n        .makerFee (0) // maker fee 0 usd per 1 lot\r\n        .build ();\r\n\r\nIs this configuration right? I don´t understood so good how baseScale should be configured. \r\n\r\nI need to add different FIAT currencies. For ARS (Argentinian pesos) and USD (American Dolares) to be exchanged for BTC and USDT (Tether). \r\n\r\nCould I configure the takerFee and makerFee as porcentual? I need to charge 0,25% for each transaction as commission.\r\n\r\n5) Place an order Limit GTC.\r\nWe are having problems placing orders.\r\n\r\nOur JSON definition:\r\n\r\n\"type\":\"OE\",\r\n\"data\": {\r\n\"uid\":301,\r\n\"orderId\": 3432342343534,\r\n\"price\": 9344,\r\n\"size\": 1,\r\n\"symbol\": \"9340\",\r\n\"type\": \"GTC\",\r\n\"action\": \"BID\" \r\n\r\nWe tried two ways to do it.\r\n\r\na) With RiskEngine enabled (default config) but is not working.\r\nmatching_1 | 2020-05-19 20: 04: 06.741 WARN 1 --- [Thread-R1_0] e.core2.core.processors.RiskEngine: 3432342343534 risk result = RISK_NSF uid = 301: Can not place OrderCommand (command = PLACE_ORDER, orderId = 3432342343534, symbol = 9340, price = 9344, size = 1, reserveBidPrice = 9344, action = BID, orderType = GTC, uid = 301, timestamp = 0, userCookie = 0, eventsGroup = 4, serviceFlags = 1, resultCode = NEW, matcherEvent = null, marketData = null)\r\nmatching_1 | 2020-05-19 20: 04: 06.747 WARN 1 --- [Thread-R1_0] e.core2.core.processors.RiskEngine: 3432342343534 accounts: {3762 = 1, 840 = 20}\r\nmatching_1 | Command result: IEventsHandler.ApiCommandResult (command = [ADD o3432342343534 s9340 u301 B: GTC: 9344: 1], resultCode = RISK_NSF, seq = 6)\r\n\r\n\r\nb) With RiskEngine disabled.

    "body": "Hi Maksim, I hava a question about the core. We are using your core as a dependency. We are trying to run the project taking our first steps to know how it works. Our first issue is related to performance. When the project start our CPU consumption goes too high (more than 500% up). Is this normal? We are running the project in development mode, using a MACBook Pro Core I5 2.9Ghz. \r\n\r\nI´m using default configuration as your readme file says\r\n        ExchangeConfiguration conf = ExchangeConfiguration.defaultBuilder().build();\r\nIf not, could be something related to the configuration?\r\nOr could you suggest me where we can find the possible issue?\r\nThanks in advance, \r\nJC",

(Performances depend on the number of subscribed users and topics, In my case, I am thinking to use RabbitMQ that can handle 1M requests per seconds aswell, and for each order, we can send more than 5 messages: For Seller and Buyer to show updated balance, trade history, orderbook etc...)\r\n- Update users balances inside NoSQL in memory database like REDIS, and balance is updated each time the order of specific user is updated.\r\n\r\nWIth all this, we can say that the number of processed orders will be decreased by more than 5x times.\r\n\r\nCan it be customized with this features ? DO you have better approach for better performances ?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance :)\r\n",

I have a few questions I want to ask you.\r\nIs the order suitable for using TreeMap?\r\nDue to the particularly large order, it may cause TreeMap to maintain its own balance, and a large number of rotations will cause performance degradation.\r\n2.UserProfile I will put it in the ChronicleMap, but I don't know if it works,\r\n3. Is it appropriate to use the Chronicle Queue to replace the missing person?\r\nI hope that you can give some advice. \r\nThank you.",
